# Consensus-Based-Task-Allocation
This project is part of my tenure at IIITD under the supervision of Dr.P.B Sujit. 

In this project, we aim to develop a auction mechanism for task alocation in multi-robot framework consisting of UAV's and Ground robots for surveillance of a terrain. The final objective of the project is to obtain a task allocation in form of are which will be taken care of ground or aerial robots such that the cost of operation remains the lowest.
